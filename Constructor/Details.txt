- Constructor is a specialized method which is called to initialize the object.
- A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint.
- Constructor declarations look like method declarationsâ€”except that they use the name of the class and have no return type.
- Constructor name is same as the class name.
- To create a new object a constructor is called by the new operator and creates space in memory for the object and initializes its fields.
- Default constructor is generated by java compiler and set the default values to the parameters if we do not define any parameterized constructor.
- You don't have to provide any constructors for your class, but you must be careful when doing this. The compiler automatically provides a no-argument, default constructor for any class without constructors. This default constructor will call the no-argument constructor of the superclass. In this situation, the compiler will complain if the superclass doesn't have a no-argument constructor so you must verify that it does. If your class has no explicit superclass, then it has an implicit superclass of Object, which does have a no-argument constructor.
- Parameterized constructor can have one or more than one parameter in the constructor.
- A class could have many constructors, including a no-argument constructor.
