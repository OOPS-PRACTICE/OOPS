Wrapper classes allow primitive values to be treated as objects.Like
byte -> Byte
short -> Short
int -> Integer
long -> Long
float -> Float
double -> Double
char -> Character
boolean -> Boolean

Since Java 5, the Java compiler automatically handles the conversion between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper objects. 
Autoboxing : The automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class object (e.g., int to Integer).
Unboxing : The automatic conversion of a wrapper class object to its corresponding primitive type (e.g., Integer to int).
