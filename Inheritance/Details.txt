Inheritance :
- In the Java language, classes can be derived from other classes, thereby inheriting fields and methods from those classes.
- A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). 
- The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).
- Excepting Object, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass (single inheritance). In the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of Object.
- Classes can be derived from classes that are derived from classes that are derived from classes, and so on, and ultimately derived from the topmost class, Object. Such a class is said to be descended from all the classes in the inheritance chain stretching back to Object.
- A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. 
- Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

What You Can Do in a Subclass
A subclass inherits all of the public and protected members of its parent, no matter what package the subclass is in. If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the package-private members of the parent. You can use the inherited members as is, replace them, hide them, or supplement them with new members:

- The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
- You can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended).
- You can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
- The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
- You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it.
- You can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
- You can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.
- You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
